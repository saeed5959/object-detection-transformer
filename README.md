# An End-to-End Object Detection with Vision Transformation


## Official implementation of "Place of Attention Matters!" in pytorch : Article is [Here](article.pdf) 
<br/>

## This work has been inspired by [vision transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929) and [Detr](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12872)

## An End-to-End Object Detection with Vision Transformation


In the object detection task, the purpose is to find the class of object and a bounding box
around it. Most works have focused on just finding the class of object without considering
bounding box features properly. We present a new method that focuses on relationships
between patches of the image as a feature for bounding box detector.
Also, we combine convolutional neural network as a local feature detector and
Transformer network as a long-distance feature detector. We were also inspired by the
method that has been used in Transformer as a relationship between patches in the image.
Our implementation can perform in real-time and improve the accuracy of previous works.
